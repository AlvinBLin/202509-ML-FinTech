## About me
Iâ€™m Jannis, a Computer Science student at RWTH Aachen University, currently on a semester abroad at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) in Taiwan. I enjoy exploring the intersection of research and software development, coding primarily in Python and C++.

Alongside my studies, I work as a student research assistant (HiWi) at Fraunhofer, a leading German research organization focused on applied science and technology, where I contribute to research projects and software solutions. Back in high school, I was honored with awards in Mathematics, Physics, and Philosophy from the respective academic societies, reflecting my curiosity and passion for problem-solving.
