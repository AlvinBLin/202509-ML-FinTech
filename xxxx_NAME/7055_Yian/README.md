# About me
Hi everyone, my name is Yian. I’m a student in the Department of IMOF. I joined this course because I’m interested in learning about machine learning and how it can be applied in life.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing the guitar, listening to music, and also playing table tennis. I’m looking forward to learning new things in this class.
