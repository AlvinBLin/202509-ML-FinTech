Hello, I'm Joyce. 
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems from college. Before starting my master's program here, I worked in the financial industry for over three years. I specialize in program coordination and B2B customer success, with strong problem-solving and communication skills. I am currently in my second year of the GMBA program at NYCU, focusing on data science as my area of specialization.
