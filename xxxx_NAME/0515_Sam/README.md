## About me

Hi! I’m Sam—a Taiwan-based quantitative researcher who codes in Python, C++, and JavaScript as fluently as I speak Mandarin. After placing Top 8 nationwide in the WorldQuant Brain Alpha Competition, I jumped into live trading: first as an alpha researcher at Medina, where I built and back-tested factor models that achieved Sharpe ratios of up to 2.1, then as an index-futures trader at Coin Trip.

I now split my time between two roles: AI Quant Intern at UC Capital, learning execution and risk management from a veteran HFT desk; and Crypto Alpha Intern at Damen, developing arbitrage tools that capture intra-exchange spot-perp price dislocations and funding-rate opportunities.

My current toolchain includes Python +pandas, PyTorch RL, TradingView Pine, Git, and an unrelenting curiosity about market microstructure.

Let’s connect if you’re building quant desks, launching crypto-arbitrage programs, or just want to geek out over stochastic calculus.
